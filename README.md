# [Sphere - A PalServer plugin](https://www.curseforge.com/palworld/lua-code-mods/sphere)

It was a project that took about six months and was a lot of fun. A huge thank you to CurseForge for the award!

# Special Thanks
I would like to extend special thanks to the members of the [UE4SS](https://discord.com/invite/7qhRGHF9Tt) Discord server who generously shared their knowledge and helped answer my questions, making this project possible.

This project was inspired by the [aytimothy](https://github.com/aytimothy/PalworldEssentials/), where i found motivation to start my own project.
